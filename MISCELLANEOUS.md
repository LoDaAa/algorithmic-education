# algorithmic-education

## Plan

Hello there! We as a team would like to submit our idea of making an algorithmic education game with some Python libraries and engine. Our main purpose will be to keep the game as educational and fun as possible, and allow new CS students to learn Sorting and Procedural algorithms by as well having fun. We are gonna have a list of basic and extensive languages in hand and we will do our best to implement them with fun tasks in game. We will keep the expectations of the game itself realistic as per Semester time period and we are gonna implement developer tools efficiently that way.
